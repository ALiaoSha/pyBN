This module provides a convenient and intuitive interface for reading/writing Bayesian Networks and performing fast inference over them. There seems to be a lack of many high-quality options for BNs in Python, so I hope this project will be a useful addition.

Current features:

Approx Inference:
- loopy belief propagation
- forward sampling
- gibbs sampliing
- likelihood weighted sampling

Exact Inference:
- Sum-Product Variable Elimination
- Clique Tree Message Passing/Belief Propagation


Future Features (To-Do List):

Structure Learning

Parameter Learning
- Bayesian Estimation
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation
